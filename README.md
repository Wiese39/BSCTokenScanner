Extracts almost all addresses from labelcloud pages of etherscan + it's forks (bscscan, snowtrace, polygon).
No intent on further developing it but if there are issues feel free to report them and I might fix them.
This repo already has a dataset of smart contracts, code is easily changeable to extract different pages (txns, recently added etc)
